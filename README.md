### Lightweight score keeper webapp

# Description -
Simple score keeping webapp featuring name and color customization.

# Purpose -
Built to help settle tennis-related point disputes between me and my cheating brothers. Every 5 points, a prompt modal reminds the user (referee) to "switch servers". No, these are not the official rules of tennis, yes, we are amatures.

# What I Learned -
- Modal functionality.
- basic CSS animation.
- Basic DOM traversal.
